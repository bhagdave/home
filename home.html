			<h1>This website project</h1>
			<p>For a long time I have wanted to just write the simplest possible website, i.e. going way back to just plain old HTML/CSS and very little in the way of images.  The result is this website which is about as easy to build as I can possibly imagine.</p>
			<p>There is one index.html file that I put together in a miniscule amount of time ( I dont actually recall). It took me longer to setup the Raspberry PI it is running on to act as a webserver.  So now when I want to create a new page I simply copy the index.html file and then change it.</p>
		         <p>And that is where the first complication comes.  I am lazy but I dont like repeating myself and copy and paste is the worst kind of duplication.  So now I need some way of including portions of the website (like the menu) without having to have the same code in all files.  So now I want to look at Server Side Includes so I can be super lazy. And that again was just a bit of apache wrangling on the server. Nothing too onerous at all.</p>
	                 <p>And then there is the deployment.  So simple to move files across to a new box.</p>
			 <p>One of the things I do want to look at is how fast the page loads.  It is running on a Model B Raspberry PI and I am intrigued what speed settings it would get from lighthouse.</p>
