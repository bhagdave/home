			<p>Well Hello there and welcome to my website.  You will not find anything of any interest here as it is just a playground for me to do odd things etc. If you do find anything interesting then please let me know.</p>
			<p>I do this every so often, just setup a webserver at home to play with and do various things with it.  This is just a plain old JAMStack type site but with nothing really happening on it.</p>
			<p>You can always visit my blog instead,but I very rarely write anything on there anymore either. In fact I plan to move it across from WordPress to this very site soon (don't gold your breath).</p>
